 # IambicCardboard

UPDATE: The 32U4 chip is needed to use arduino keyboard usb libraries.

The IambicCardboard is an ultra-low cost morse code learning aid device.

It consists of an arduino 32U4 with micro USB connector, a buzzer, two pieces of copper tape and two pieces of cardboard smashed together to form morse code "paddles".

Powered by USB, the device will allow the student to key continuous perfectly spaced dits and dahs and hear them through the speaker. 

Additionally as a USB keyboard device, morse code input will result in ascii text output to the attached USB host (computer).
